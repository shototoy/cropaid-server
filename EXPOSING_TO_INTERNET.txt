HOW TO EXPOSE YOUR LOCAL SERVER TO THE INTERNET
===============================================
To allow the CropAid app (running on mobile phones or other networks) to connect to your computer-hosted backend, you need to make your local server accessible via a public URL.

Here are the two best methods:

METHOD 1: Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended - Easiest & Secure)
------------------------------------------------------------
This method provides a FREE https:// URL (secure) and works even if your router blocks ports. No router configuration needed.

1. Download 'cloudflared' for Windows:
   https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/

2. Open Command Prompt where you downloaded it.

3. Run the tunnel pointing to your local server port (3000):
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000

4. Copy the unique URL it generates (example: https://crop-aid-demo.trycloudflare.com).

5. On your Frontend Computer (Development):
   - Open .env file
   - Update VITE_API_URL=https://crop-aid-demo.trycloudflare.com/api
   - Re-run 'npm run build'
   - Re-deploy to XAMPP.

METHOD 2: Ngrok (Good for quick testing)
----------------------------------------
Similar to Cloudflare but free tier has limits or temporary URLs.

1. Install Ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Run: ngrok http 3000
3. Use the https URL it provides in your .env configuration.

METHOD 3: Port Forwarding (Advanced - Permanent)
------------------------------------------------
1. Find your computer's Local IP (run 'ipconfig', e.g., 192.168.1.5).
2. Log in to your Router Admin Panel.
3. Find "Port Forwarding" settings.
4. Add a rule: 
   - External Port: 3000
   - Internal Port: 3000
   - Internal IP: Your Local IP (192.168.1.5)
5. Find your Public IP (search "what is my ip" on Google).
6. Your connection URL is: http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:3000/api
7. Update .env with this URL and rebuild.

Note: Your Public IP might change after restarting your router unless you pay for a Static IP or use DDNS.

IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING:
---------------------------
When exposing your server, anyone with the URL can attempt to access it.
- Ensure you have changed the JWT_SECRET in .env.
- Ensure your database passwords are strong.
